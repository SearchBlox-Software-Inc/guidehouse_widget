**SbCore.js:**
*getSBResponse()* - getSBResponse function, checks the url parameters, and uses the same parameters to send a request to the searchblox server and returns the response.
*urlCheck()*- to function to check response URL includes any navigation domains mentione din facet.js
*getAutoSuggest()* - sends a request to SearchBloxServer for auto- suggestion list and returns the response.
*getSuggestClickCount()*- function to track which  suggestions are clicked in to analytics
*getFeaturedResultClickCount()* - function to track which  suggestions are clicked in to analytics
*getInitialUrlParameters()* - function to parse the facets in facet.js and initial url parameters page, pagesize, sortdir, sort, col on page load.
*clearAllFilters()*- function to clear applied filters whenever search term is changed.
*getDocumentClickCount()*- function to track page click into analytics.
*getResults()* - formats the url parameters and loads the page each time search is done.
*parseAppliedFiltersFromUrl()* - reads the URL and brings all the applied filters into a single format, so that we can display the selected filters.
*parseSBResponse()* - function to format response into required way.

**FacetFiltersComponent.js:**
Renders the facets and has <Facet /> component for each facet in facets.
*toggleFilter()* - toggles filters.
Checks if filter already exists. Checks are based on current URL.
If filter exists then checks are done if array/string/existing filters are removed. If filter doesn't exist, then it is added as a string.
If an already different filter exists in the same type then added to the array.
*facetToggle()* - slideToggle facets
*clearAllFilters()* - clears all applied filters

**SearchInputComponent.js:**
In changeSearchInput(), input field value is set state as query and in searchEnter() function enterupdate is set as true if keycode 13(I.e., enter) and that query is passed into getInitialUrlParameters() which parses the facets in facet.js
On load, url params and using the function getResults will get a response for the query in the input field.

**App.js:**
*If security is enabled first it shows login page and after authentication is successful it redirects to SearchUIComponent.js
*If there's no security enabled it directly shows SearchUIComponent page where we have search and other components required.

**Facet.js:**
Properties- Brief Explanation:
*Facet.js is the configuration file that provides options which can be configured to provide search results as required. This document will let you know about each parameter that has been used with the related front end.
*Few parameters for facet.js can be passed from index.html (eg:sb_autosuggest,sb_facet_settings,sb_plugin_domain) and these parameters are considered as priority to values added in facet,js file
*Eg:* let facetSettings = document.getElementById("sb_facet_settings");
window.autoSuggestObject = {};
let autoSuggestSettings = document.getElementById("sb_autosuggest");
if(autoSuggestSettings){
  window.autoSuggestObject.showAutoSuggest = autoSuggestSettings.value;
}
*These values are read in facet.js file .

**"facets":[]** - Facets or search filters will be shown in the UI so that user can filter search results to make search easier.

**customDateSettings: {}** - Custom date settings can be configured to display any custom date facet filters.
You can define ‘customDateField’ with your custom date filter as well as enable this setting to be shown in the plugin page using setting ‘customDateEnable:true’. You can also set the custom date display name as per your requirement using property ‘customDateDisplayText’..

**"collection":[]** - One or more collections will be considered from where search results will be served. Here we will provide collection IDs as values. Multiple collection IDs can be given using comma as a seperator. If you don’t give any value, search results will be served from all available collections.

**"sortBtns":[]:**
```
"sortBtns":[
  {"field":"<metaDateField>","display":"Date ",checkedvalue:””},
  {"field":"relevance","display":"Relevance",checkedvalue:””}
 {"field":"relevance","display":"Relevance with MRank",checkedvalue:”mrank”}
]
```
-SortBtns parameter is used to display a list of sorting filters that are being used for the UI. Here we are using ‘Date’ , ‘Relevance’ and “Relevance with MRank '' as per  requirement.

By default metaDateField is lastmodified. You can customize it as per your requirement.

*<metaDateField>* - date display will be considered from metaDateField value. By default it was mentioned “lastmodified” as value.

*For plugin added custom date fields below are the list of custom date formats considered by SearchBlox:

```
metaDateField
Mapping.json Node Date Format
article:modified_time
yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
DC.date.reviewed
yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS
YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.ss
dateModified
yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
DCTERMS.dateModified
yyyy-MM-dd
YYYY-MM-DD
dc:date
yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZZ
YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ssZ
```

**NOTE:**
Each custom date field should have the same date format for all documents at collection level.

**"facetFiltersOrder":[]:**
```
"facetFiltersOrder":[
  "Facetfield1”,”facetfield2”,”facetfield3”
]
```
- We can define the order of the facet filters.

**“facetsFiltersDisplay”:**- To show the facet filters on the plugin page, this setting has to be enabled.

**facetsFiltersDisplay:**- You can set facets to be enabled/disabled.

**"facetFiltersType": "AND"**- facet filters from facets property will be considered with AND logic

**"sortDir":"desc"**- Sort by date is the default sorting technique and sort direction is descending order.

**"showAutoSuggest": "true"** - With this auto suggestion feature, plugin UI will be shown with a list of related search query suggestions when user types search query (characters) in the search box.

**“autoSuggestLimit”** - to limit the number of auto suggestion to display in UI

**suggestSearch:** - if a particular query has no results and has a suggestion term , that term is taken as a query and  search is triggered.

**“smartAutoSuggestSettings”:{...}** - smart auto suggestion needs a smart suggest link to use the feature. You will need to set up basic configuration info with this section.

**“showTrendingData”** - making this to true will render a trending component which is a combination of smart suggestions and top suggestion on keydown of search box.

**"adsDisplay":"true"**- This is related to Featured Results (Key Matches) Display. Featured Results will display only when it is true.

**"featuredResultsCount":**- This parameter value controls the number of featured results  to be displayed in the front-end search page.

**"relatedQuery":{"field":"true"}** -If the field value is true, related queries will appear in the UI.
"relatedQueryFields":

**"relatedQueryFields":**

**relatedQueryFields: {...}**
   -If you use related queries, you will need to provide all the required configuration here.
**{"apikey":"","field":"content","operator":"and","limit":"5","terms":"10","type":"phrase","col":"12"}**
   -You will need to configure relatedQueryFields properties such as:
*apikey* - You will need to add index server’s api key.
*field* - related queries will be considered from search result title based on given search term. You can configure it to any SearchBlox field such as content etc.
*operator*- If search term has multiple words or operator will be considered. You can switch it to AND for accurate results.
*limit* - Its the limit for Number of related queries display.
*terms* - Narrow search results can be shown up to 10 terms(words) you can alter it based on your requirement.
*type* - related search response display type is phrase.
*col* - This is nothing but a collection ID to consider related queries from.

**"topQuery":{"field":"true"}**
  -If field value is true, popular queries will appear in the UI.

**"topQueryFields":**
  -If you use popular queries, you will need to provide all the required configuration here.
**{"apikey":"","col":"12","limit":"5"}**
*apikey* - You will need to add index server’s api key.
*col*- This is nothing but a collection ID to consider popular queries from. By default it will be the collection ID that we use for that particular UI cname or defaultCname value.
*limit* - Its the limit for Number of popular queries display.

**"tuneTemplate": “WEB”**
   -By default tuning template is set to WEB.tuning values of web template
We can create custom templates in admin console and providing that template name in.
**“voiceSearch”: “false”**
   -Voice search can be enabled in plugin by making  it to true.
**"debug":false**
   -Making this to true will display the response in JSON format in UI.
**"autologout":true**
   -By making autologout to true  ,if the user is inactive on the page more than certain period of time , page will automatically logout and displays login page in UI

**"voiceSearchAPI":"https://demo.searchblox.com:8443/searchblox/rest/v2/api/speech/text"**
**"defaultType":"OR"**
   -To meet  search requirements efficiently, we added this feature ‘defaultType’ and value is given as OR so when multiple words are given in a search query, all words will be considered from a document and served in the search page.
**"pluginDomain": ""**
   -search results can be domain specific. So whenever you assign a domain, search results will be displayed from that particular domain… If you don’t mention any value it will take search results from where the plugin has been deployed.

**SearchUIComponent.js:**
-Search and other Components will be rendered on page load.
-FacetFiltersComponent,SortComponent, etc is displayed once the search results come up.
-Based on the response different ui’s are shown using conditions.

**tools:**
-These files will be helpful for the build purpose and also to run the plugin in a local environment.
-The port can be mentioned in these files.

#**STEPS TO RUN REACT PLUGIN LOCALLY**

**Installation:**
- Install node.js using the link below (probably 14 or higher):
- https://nodejs.org/en/download/

**Steps to Import node modules into project:**
I.  Open the command prompt with plugin path (Eg:  C:\plugin)

II. Use the command “npm install” to get all the dependencies into the project with folder name node_modules.

III. Use the command “npm start” to run the plugin.

IV. Plugin will be opened in default browser with port number 9010 as mentioned in the file tools/devserver.js

V. If plugin is running outside of SearchBlox Server (i.e., local environment), We need to configure the pluginDomain in src/facet.js to get the results.
eg: "pluginDomain": "https://13.10.24.161:8443"

#**Steps to Upload Plugins in SearchBlox:**

- To upload a custom plugin through UI, it should be in zip file format. Rename the zip file for the plugin (whatever the custom plugin name you prefer. Eg: customui.zip).
- Start SearchBlox service. To install and start SearchBlox refer the following link:
https://developer.searchblox.com/docs/installing-searchblox-on-windows
- Once SearchBlox is started, From Admin Console, Go to Dashboard > Collections > Search Settings Tab and click on the Upload Search Template button.
- Choose the Custom Plugin zip file and click on the open button.
- Once custom plugin upload is done you will see the 'Upload Plugin' section goes off from the screen. You can check that the custom plugin name folder is available in <SEARCHBLOX_INSTALLATION_PATH>/webapps/ROOT/.
- Then, you can access the custom plugin using the following link:
https://localhost:8443/customui/index.html
- You can make the custom plugin facet.js configuration before/after the plugin upload.
